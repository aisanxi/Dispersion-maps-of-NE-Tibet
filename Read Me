Package NE_Tibet_Ray_Lov includes Rayleigh and Love wave phase velocities,and Rayleigh wave azimuth anisotropy measurements from ambient noise eikonal tomography.


For example, the file below records the Rayleigh wave azimuth anisotropy measurements at 6 s.
NE_Tibet_Ray_Lov/Ray.azi_anisotropy.per_6.lst:
longitude, latitude, isotropic phase velocity, anisotropy strength, fast direction are listed in each row in sequence

The file below records the Rayleigh wave isotropic phase velocities at 32 s
NE_Tibet_Ray_Lov/Ray.ph.per_32.lst
longitude, latitude, isotropic phase velocity are listed in each row in sequence
